''' The function takes a (L)ist and a (S)earch element and then makes takes the highest value as the last possible 
    index of the list (Remember that binary searches only work on lists that are sorted). The low value is at the 
    first position of the list and mid will be the high and low positions halved. While the list isn't empty, and 
    the mid and high values aren't the same, check to see if the (S)earch element is less than the element at the 
    middle of the list - if the (S)earch element is less than the element at mid then the middle point is the half 
    of the first part of the list, and the loop runs from the top again. Elif (S)earch element is greater than the 
    element at the position then the mid is changed to the middle of the upper half. If the values are the same 
    then just return the position in the list where the same values were found. When none of these conditions are 
    satisfied, return -1 '''
